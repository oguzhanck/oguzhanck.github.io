				<h3>Standard</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The standard type of motorcycle is a common favorite because it has a simple design and is suited
						for all purposes. It has variations from 125cc up to 1,000cc and can be fit with luggage, a tank
						bag, a different seat, and it makes a good first and all-around motorcycle to ride. It doesn’t
						normally come with a large fairing on the front if it has one at all. Ergonomics are pretty
						neutral as it isn’t very forward leaning or rearward reclining. Seat height usually is in the
						shorter to middle range and can usually fit almost everyone comfortably. We recommend looking at
						the Yamaha SR400 for a good all-around town motorcycle. It’s not too large for a beginner, yet
						not too small for an experienced rider.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Cruiser</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The cruiser, also nicknamed a chopper, was designed for cruising, hence, how it got its name. It
						typically has a little lower seat height, making it a good “cruising” around-town motorcycle,
						but with a little added luggage, it can make a good weekend rider. The engine sizes again are
						pretty varied from a small displacement engine through 1,000cc or more depending on the brand.
						You may feel more like you’re sitting in a cruiser than on it, but it’s a great option for both
						new and experienced riders. When you imagine a cruiser (specifically a chopper), Harley-Davidson
						may be the first brand that comes to mind. We recommend looking at the H-D Low Rider for a good
						example of a cruiser. It’s a low slung motorcycle that can travel for miles and has a lot of
						accessories to make it a great motorcycle for a quick trip or a good weekend out on the road.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Sport Bike
				</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The sport genre of motorcycles are meant for speed and agility with forward-leaning ergonomics
						ready to carve some corners while riding. One of the largest differences with a Sport type
						motorcycle is their weight. They are generally one of the lighter motorcycles made from a lot of
						aluminum and lighter materials to increase the side to side maneuverability. The seat height is
						usually on the higher end to be able to lean the motorcycle farther without scraping foot pegs
						or fairings. Shorter riders may be on their tiptoes with the taller seat height. Suzuki is
						thought of as the starter of this type of motorcycle in the 1980s with the GSXR line-up. Still
						going strong today, we’d recommend looking at the Suzuki GSXR600 as a good motorcycle for this
						type. It has enough power to do everything, and with added accessories, it can be made into a
						comfortable (within reason) weekend sport-touring motorcycle.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Touring</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The Touring type of motorcycle is typically larger than most other motorcycles and it’s meant to
						have the amenities for cross-country touring to see the beaches on both coasts. They offer a
						large amount of storage with easy ergonomics that allow you to ride for hours at a time. They
						will have the largest fairings to block the wind and weather while riding. Engine sizes are
						typically large to be able to keep up highway speeds and haul a large amount of extra gear and
						extra clothes. The first thing you may think of for a Touring motorcycle is the Honda Goldwing.
						You commonly see them with 100,000 miles on the odometer and the current owner may be the
						original owner with some big stories to tell about “that one time when…” They seem to last
						forever and can be great for a simple trip or a blast for the weekend to see the biggest ball of
						yarn in the US of A.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Dual Sport</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Dual Sports are meant to go anywhere and doing anything. They bring the road features of lights
						and a horn but have more aggressive off-road suspension and possible knobby off-road tires. The
						seat height is generally a little taller to navigate the backroads and off beaten paths you can
						find on the backroads. They typically have limited storage options from the dealership, but can
						be outfitted with a number of extra bags to carry quite a bit of gear for a good weekend camping
						adventure. The KTM 1090 Adventure R mixes off-road capability with sporty looks and feel that
						can do anything. It has a higher seat height but doesn’t have too much power to make it a
						handful for a weekend ride. If you want to go on a long cruise, it can do that also. Outfit it
						with all the gear you need to make a few lasting memories.</p>
